# Cloud Computing Course Projects
This repository includes projects description and related materials for a *graduate-level* **Cloud Computing** Course. These materials have been used in the fall of 2019 @ *Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran*.

## Projects Overview
Students were challenged with two projects:
* **OpenStack Basic Administration:** this project was introduced to gain a better understanding of how a cloud computing infrastructure is setup and learn the basic services that cooperatively make the cloud what it is. We presented DevStack (an OpenStack development environment). Students were given three weeks to complete their tasks and this project included 40% of the whole project section marks.
* **Elastic E-Shopping System:** issues regarding *availability* and *elasticity* lead to the introduction of native cloud architecture, ***microservices***. This project consisted of two phases; in the first phase, students were instructed to write a restful service for a section of the system, called *Accountico* (Account Management Service) and turn it into a *microservice* (aka, dockerizing the service), using **Docker**. Incentives behind this part of the project was familiarizing students with how microservices are created and how they can integrate with their databases. In the next phase, they were asked to modify their microservice to make it compatible with the rest of the system which were provided as *Docker Images*. Eventually, to make the whole system *elastic* and *highly available*, they were asked to deploy the system into a cluster of three nodes using ***Docker Swarm*** orchestration tool. Students were given three weeks for each phase and each one received an equal share of 30% of the whole project section marks.
